Gallery of existing Lurch Sites To create your own Lurch site, follow the instructions below. Step 1. Fork an existing Lurch Site To find a site you want to use as the starting point for your new site, see our gallery . Once you have selected a site, visit its GitHub repository; you can find a link to that repository in the gallery. For example, the Developer Site's repository is at github.com/lurchmath/lurch . If you're new to the concept of \"forking\" on GitHub, see GitHub's forking instructions . You simply visit the repository you're forking, click the \"Fork\" menu on the top right, choose to create a new fork, and fill out a form like the following one. Once you have followed those instructions, you will have your own separate copy of the Lurch Site that you forked, but it will not yet be visible on the web. Step 2. Enable web access Until you do this, you cannot view your newly-created Lurch Site on the web. Here are the steps to enable web access for your Lurch Site: Visit the repository you just created in the previous step, probably named something like github.com/your-github-username/your-new-fork . Click the \"Settings\" tab near the top of the page. Click the Pages section from the left navigation bar. Ensure that the \"Source\" menu has \"Deploy from a branch\" selected. Ensure the \"Branch\" settings are for \"main\" and \"root.\" Click the Save button. It will take a few minutes for these changes to take effect. Then visit the website for your new fork, probably something like: http://your-github-username.github.io/your-new-fork/app Verify that your copy of the Lurch app is live. Optional Step 3. Change the default configuration You can do this step now, or later, or leave the configuration at its default. To change the configuration for your new site: View the README.md file in the config/ folder of your forked repository. It explains the various ways you can configure the app, and all the options available to you. Changing the configuration will require editing one or more files in the repository, which you can do in many ways. Here are a few options; select whichever of these options seems most convenient to you. (You need only one of these methods.) Recommended option: Find the file you want to change in the repository on GitHub and click the edit button (pencil icon) on the top right. See the screenshot below. Commit your changes when done. Press the period (\".\") key while viewing your repository to open an editor in the browser. Commit your changes when done. Open a GitHub Codespace from the \"Code\" menu on GitHub and work there. Commit your changes when done. Clone the repository to your computer and make changes there, then push them back to GitHub. Optional Step 4. Add mathematical documents You will almost surely want to add your own mathematical documents to your site at some point, but it is not necessary to do so immediately. The instructions below assume that you have already written some mathematical documents. Perhaps you did so using the Lurch app in your new site or another Lurch Site or perhaps you copied the files from elsewhere (with the author's permission, of course). Choose whichever of the following methods you prefer to upload your Lurch files into the math/ folder of your Lurch Site's repository. (You need to choose only one of these methods.) Recommended option: View the math/ folder in the repository, and click \"Add file\" in the top right, and choose \"Upload files.\" If you have the repository opened in a GitHub Codespace, you can drag the files into the editor's file browser (the left hand site). Commit your changes. If you cloned the repository to your computer, just add the files to your local copy, commit them, and push them to GitHub. You may wish to verify that the files you uploaded can accessed from your Lurch Site's copy of the Lurch app. You can do so in two different ways: Method 1: Using File > Open Visit the Lurch app in your Lurch Site. Click the File > Open menu item. In the dialog that appears, select \"From the web.\" Enter the URL to one of the files you uploaded, in the following form: http://your-github-username.github.io/your-new-fork/math/your-file-name.lurch Verify that it opens successfully in the Lurch app. Method 2: Using a direct link This method is useful because it allows you to create a single URL that opens a file you've written directly in the Lurch app in your Lurch Site. This can be useful for sharing with students, for example, to open a homework assignment in one click. Let's assume you have a file named homework-1.lurch in the math/ folder of your Lurch Site repository. Build a URL as follows, and visit it in your browser: http://your-github-username.github.io/your-new-fork/app/index.html?load=/math/homework-1.lurch Optional Step 5. Add/modify supporting web pages Right now, if users try to visit http://your-github-username.github.io/your-new-fork , they will get one of two results: If you forked a Lurch Site that had no landing page, the visitor will get a \"not found\" error. If you forked a Lurch Site that had a landing page, the visitor will see the landing page from the original Lurch Site that you forked. You may wish to create your own landing page, and possibly additional pages, perhaps with information about a course you're teaching, or a list of Lurch documents in your repository. We provide an Example Lurch Site that you may wish to imitate. (See link below.) Feel free to fill the root folder of your Lurch Site's repository with as many HTML files as you like. The one named index.html is the default landing page and can link to as many others as you wish to create. If you want any of those pages to link directly to one of the Lurch documents in your repository's math/ folder, opening it in your Lurch Site's copy of the Lurch app, use the method in the previous section for building a URL that does exactly that. You can also imitate the links you'll find in the landing page for the Example Lurch Site.

Especially when a Lurch notation expression uses unicode characters, there is typically a plain-text alternative, to make it easier to type.","title":"Lurch notation reference"},{"location":"lurch-notation/#logic","text":"Lurch notation Meaning P and Q \\(P\\text{ and }Q\\) P\u2227Q \\(P\\text{ and }Q\\) P or Q \\(P\\text{ or }Q\\) P\u2228Q \\(P\\text{ or }Q\\) not P \\(\\neg P\\) \u00acP \\(\\neg P\\) P implies Q \\(P\\Rightarrow Q\\) P\u21d2Q \\(P\\Rightarrow Q\\) P iff Q \\(P\\Leftrightarrow Q\\) P\u21d4Q \\(P\\Leftrightarrow Q\\) contradiction \\(\\rightarrow\\leftarrow\\) \u2192\u2190 \\(\\rightarrow\\leftarrow\\)","title":"Logic"},{"location":"lurch-notation/#quantifiers-and-bindings","text":"Lurch notation Meaning forall x.x<x+1 \\(\\forall x, x<x+1\\) for all x.x<x+1 \\(\\forall x, x<x+1\\) \u2200x.x<x+1 \\(\\forall x, x<x+1\\) exists x.x=2 cdot x \\(\\exists x, x=2x\\) \u2203x.x=2\u22c5x \\(\\exists x, x=2x\\) exists unique x.x=2 cdot x \\(\\exists ! x, x=2x\\) \u2203!x.x=2\u22c5x \\(\\exists ! x, x=2x\\) x.x+2 \\(x, x+1\\) x\u21a6x+2 \\(x, x+1\\)","title":"Quantifiers and bindings"},{"location":"lurch-notation/#algebraic-expressions","text":"Lurch notation Meaning (x) \\(\\left(x\\right)\\) x+y \\(x+y\\) 2+x+y \\(2+x+y\\) -x \\(-x\\) 1-x \\(1-x\\) x*y \\(x y\\) x cdot y \\(x y\\) x\u22c5y \\(x y\\) 2*x*y \\(2 x y\\) 2 cdot x cdot y \\(2 x y\\) 2\u22c5x\u22c5y \\(2 x y\\) 2*3*x \\(2\\cdot 3 x\\) 2 cdot 3 cdot x \\(2\\cdot 3 x\\) 2\u22c53\u22c5x \\(2\\cdot 3 x\\) 1/x \\(\\frac{1}{x}\\) 2*1/x*y \\(2\\frac{1}{x}y\\) (2*1)/(x*y) \\(\\frac{(2\\cdot 1)}{(xy)}\\) x^2 \\(x^2\\) x factorial \\(x!\\) x\uff01 \\(x!\\)","title":"Algebraic expressions"},{"location":"lurch-notation/#set-theory","text":"Lurch notation Meaning x in A \\(x\\in A\\) x\u2208A \\(x\\in A\\) x notin A \\(x\\notin A\\) x\u2209A \\(x\\notin A\\) A subset B \\(A\\subseteq B\\) A subseteq B \\(A\\subseteq B\\) A\u2286B \\(A\\subseteq B\\) A cup B \\(A\\cup B\\) A union B \\(A\\cup B\\) A\u222aB \\(A\\cup B\\) A cap B \\(A\\cap B\\) A intersect B \\(A\\cap B\\) A\u2229B \\(A\\cap B\\) A setminus B \\(A\\setminus B\\) A\u2216B \\(A\\setminus B\\) A complement \\(A^\\circ\\) A\u00b0 \\(A^\\circ\\) f:A\u2192B \\(f\\colon A\\to B\\) f(x) \\(f\\left(x\\right)\\) g circ f \\(g\\circ f\\) g\u2218f \\(g\\circ f\\) A times B \\(A\\times B\\) A\u00d7B \\(A\\times B\\) \u27e8x,y\u27e9 \\(\\langle x,y \\rangle\\)","title":"Set Theory"},{"location":"lurch-notation/#relations","text":"Lurch notation Meaning x < 0 \\(x<0\\) x lt 0 \\(x<0\\) x leq 0 \\(x\\leq 0\\) x \u2264 0 \\(x\\leq 0\\) x neq 0 \\(x\\neq 0\\) x ne 0 \\(x\\neq 0\\) x\u22600 \\(x\\neq 0\\) m | n \\(m\\mid n\\) m divides n \\(m\\mid n\\) a\u2248b mod m \\(a\\underset{m}{\\equiv}b\\) x~y \\(x\\sim y\\) x~y~z \\(x\\sim y\\sim z\\) x=y \\(x=y\\) x=y=z \\(x=y=z\\) X loves Y \\(X\\text{ loves }Y\\) X is Y \\(X\\text{ is }Y\\) X is an Y \\(X\\text{ is }Y\\) X is a Y \\(X\\text{ is }Y\\) P is a partition of A \\(P\\text{ is a partition of }A\\) '~' is an equivalence relation \\(\\sim\\text{ is equivalence relation}\\) [a] \\(\\left[a\\right]\\) [a,~] \\(\\left[a\\right]_{\\sim}\\) '~' is a strict partial order \\(\\sim\\text{ is strict partial order}\\) '~' is a partial order \\(\\sim\\text{ is partial order}\\) '~' is a total order \\(\\sim\\text{ is total order}\\)","title":"Relations"},{"location":"lurch-notation/#assumptions-and-declarations-case-insensitive","text":"Lurch notation Meaning Assume P \\(\\text{Assume }P\\) Given P \\(\\text{Assume }P\\) Suppose P \\(\\text{Assume }P\\) If P \\(\\text{Assume }P\\) :P \\(\\text{Assume }P\\) Let x \\(\\text{Let }x\\) Let x be such that x in \u211d \\(\\text{Let }x\\text{ be such that }x\\in\\mathbb{R}\\) Let x such that x in \u211d \\(\\text{Let }x\\text{ be such that }x\\in\\mathbb{R}\\) f(c)=0 for some c \\(f(c)=0\\text{ for some }c\\) Declare is 0 + cos \\(\\text{Declare is, 0, +, and cos}\\)","title":"Assumptions and Declarations (case insensitive)"},{"location":"lurch-notation/#miscellaneous","text":"Lurch notation Meaning f\u207b(x) \\(f^-\\left(x\\right)\\) f recip(x) \\(f^-\\left(x\\right)\\) f inv(x) \\(f^-\\left(x\\right)\\) x recip \\(x^-\\) x inv \\(x^-\\) x\u207b \\(x^-\\) \u03bbP(k) \\(\\lambda{P}(k)\\)","title":"Miscellaneous"},{"location":"lurch-sites-gallery/","text":"Gallery of Lurch Sites This is a gallery of all the Lurch Sites that have been created by the Lurch developers and community.

The problem Lurch Sites solve While it's true that anyone can try Lurch online right now , that copy of the app is the \"plain vanilla\" version, which means: it has the default configuration (just one of many possible ways to configure the app), and it does not include any example mathematical definitions, axioms, or theorems, so you can do only very tiny and uninteresting proofs. We cannot solve this problem just by adding to that app a lot of documents that define interesting mathematics, because every author has a different style, a different set of preferred topics, a different way of teaching. We do not want to force any one style or set of axioms on the user. How Lurch Sites solve that problem The link above, which goes to the \"plain vanilla\" version of the app, should not be considered the definitive copy of the app; rather, there is no definitive copy. We allow anyone with a GitHub account to fork that repository and, in that fork, configure the app to their own preferences. They can also upload whatever mathematical documents they've authored into that new repository. Then if they enable web access to that repository, they will have a copy of Lurch running that behaves the way they want and includes the mathematics that they want. We call such a repository a Lurch Site. We maintain on this website a gallery of Lurch Sites , so that new users don't need to create their own Lurch Site, but might find that someone has already built what they need.
