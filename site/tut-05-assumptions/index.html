<h1 id="making-assumptions">Making assumptions</h1>
<p>Let's take a second look at the example document below, which you saw already in
<a href="../tut-04-validation/">the previous tutorial</a>.
Why did Lurch put positive feedback on the second expression, but not the first?</p>
<div class='lurch-embed' width='100%' height='300px' validate='true'>
Let's state the obvious.  First, we `assume x < 0`.

Then we can surely conclude (drum roll) that `x < 0`!
</div>

<p>In mathematics, most facts are not proven in isolation, but only after making
certain <em>assumptions.</em>  A theorem will say, "If such-and-such a fact, then we
know that some other facts."  This is why in a geometry class, many textbooks
let a student justify a line in a proof with the word "given."  Lurch has
support for this essential piece of mathematical reasoning.</p>
<h2 id="the-user-interface-for-assumptions">The user interface for assumptions</h2>
<p>To make an expression into an assumption, you use a different technique
depending on which editing mode you prefer.  (Recall the three editing modes
introduced at the end of <a href="../tut-03-meaningful-math/">an earlier tutorial</a>.)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In beginner mode,</strong> there is a checkbox in the expression editing dialog
   that says "Assumption" and is unchecked by default.  Check it to make an
   expression into an assumption; leave it unchecked to have your expression
   treated as an ordinary statement.</li>
<li><strong>In intermediate mode,</strong> the top of the expression editing dialog has a
   drop-down menu for choosing the kind of content you're inserting.  One of the
   options is "Assumption," in contrast to the default "Statement."  (There are
   many other options on that drop-down that we will come to in later tutorial
   pages.)</li>
<li><strong>In advanced mode,</strong> you must include in the input you provide a word that
   signals that the content is an assumption.  For isntance, instead of typing
   <code>x&lt;0</code> into the dialog box, you can type <code>Assume x&lt;0</code>.  For a full list of the
   words that signal "assumption," see the
   <a href="../lurch-notation/">Lurch notation reference page</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="feedback-about-assumptions">Feedback about assumptions</h2>
<p>Lurch checks your reasoning to see if any of the steps in it are invalid.  But
in mathematics, you're allowed to assume whatever you want.  (Some assumptions
are more useful or strategic than others, but no assumption is an example of
invalid reasoning.)  Consequently, Lurch does not mark assumptions as right or
wrong; it just doesn't mark them at all.  You can see this in the document shown
at the top of this page.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Exercise: Make/break assumptions</p>
<ol>
<li>Edit the document at the top of this page.  Change the first expression
   so that it is no longer an assumption, and ask Lurch to check your
   reasoning.</li>
<li>Does its response make sense to you?  (If not, see the explanation
   below.)</li>
<li>Try toggling the "assumption" status of that same expression using the
   other editing modes as well (beginner, intermediate, and advanced).</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2 id="keeping-mistakes-local">Keeping mistakes local</h2>
<p>When your document has two copies of the expression <span class="arithmatex">\(x&lt;0\)</span>, and neither one is
marked as an assumption, Lurch grades the first one as unjustified and the
second one as justified.  The reason for this is that Lurch does not propagate
your errors throughout your document, but tries to keep them as contained as
possible.  To explain this better, consider the following example.</p>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Betsy is a geometry student who wrote a 10-line proof and submitted it for
homework.  All the work is correct, except for line 4, which is not properly
justified.  How many points does Betsy get for this homework problem?</p>
</div>
<p>Perhaps some geometry teachers would give Betsy 9 out of 10 points, because 9
lines were correct and 10 were incorrect.  Perhaps other teachers would give her
3 out of 10 points, because the first 3 lines were correct, but everything after
that is suspect, because lines 5-10 might rely on the invalid line 4.</p>
<p>Lurch tries to be as generous as possible.  <strong>If one of your statements is not
sufficiently justified, Lurch marks it as such, but later statements are still
free to rely on the unjustified one.</strong>  Thus a proof with even one unjustified
statement is not a complete proof, even if all the statements but one have green
check marks on them.</p>
<p>We chose to have Lurch behave this way because it permits students to assemble a
proof in any order.  For example, many instructors teach students to work "from
the outside in," building some of the starting lines and some of the concluding
lines for a proof, before filling in one or two insightful steps in the middle
that connects it all together.  For example, we will later see examples of
proofs like the following, and Lurch will grade most of the work as correct.</p>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Let <span class="arithmatex">\(x\)</span> be arbitrary, then assume <span class="arithmatex">\(x&gt;0\)</span>.  Consequenly, <span class="arithmatex">\(x^2+1&gt;0\)</span>.</p>
<p>(Here's the part I need to fill in before submitting my homework!)</p>
<p>My goal is to show that <span class="arithmatex">\(x^2+k&gt;p\)</span>.  Once I've shown that, I can conclude
that for any <span class="arithmatex">\(x&gt;0\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(x^2+k&gt;p\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>In such a proof, Lurch will mark every statement other than the first <span class="arithmatex">\(x^2+k&gt;p\)</span>
correct, because <em>only that one line</em> is missing its justification.  This allows
students to get positive feedback about their work en route to a complete proof,
even if they don't choose to write it in the order it will eventually be read.</p>
