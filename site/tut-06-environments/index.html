<h1 id="creating-and-using-environments">Creating and using environments</h1>
<p>The very tiny Lurch documents we've seen so far are just to get us started.
They are not, of course, representative of real work with the application.
Typical mathematical documents will contain multiple theorem statements and
their corresponding proofs, possibly with other content as well, such as
explanations in between the theorems.</p>
<h2 id="the-need-for-environments">The need for environments</h2>
<p>We therefore need a way to express when a proof begins and when it ends,
as well as where theorem statements begin and end.  We do this with a feature
called <em>environments.</em></p>
<p>Consider the document below, which uses the most basic theorem from
propositional logic to illustrate both a <em>theorem</em> environment (the statement of
the theorem) and a <em>proof</em> environment (the proof of the theorem).</p>
<div class='lurch-embed' width='100%' height='400px' validate='true'>
<theorem>
`If P` is true, then we can conclude that `P` is true.
</theorem>
<proof>
Like the theorem says, we'll `assume P` to begin.  Then, obviously, `P` is true,
so the theorem is proven.
</proof>
</div>

<p>Environments are shown, by default, with blue borders around them, just like
expressions are, to indicate that they are meaningful portions of the document
that Lurch is paying attention to when grading your work.  For example, in the
small document above, you can see that not only does the final expression in the
proof get a green check mark, but the proof as a whole gets a green check mark,
as does the corresponding theorem.  That's because Lurch knows what those
environments mean, and that they should be checked as part of its grading
process.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Exercise: Mess it up</p>
<p>Adjust the document shown above so that the proof is no longer valid.
(For example, you could change the final <span class="arithmatex">\(P\)</span> to a <span class="arithmatex">\(Q\)</span>.)
Ask Lurch to check the document again.  Which feedback icons changed?</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition danger">
<p class="admonition-title">Surprise!</p>
<p>If you did the exercise above, you may be surprised to see the result.
Why does the theorem keep its green check marks even though its proof is
invalid?  Is Lurch making a mistake?</p>
<p><em>This is not typical.  It is happening here because this theorem is trivial.</em></p>
<p>Lurch actually knows that the theorem is true as soon as it reads it,
without seeing the proof, because the theorem is self-evidently true.
So it grades the theorem correct without even reading the proof.
But then the proof is incorrect, and so is graded as such.</p>
<p>But the overwhelming majority of theorems are not trivially true, and thus
Lurch will rely on the proof you provide.  If you provide an invalid proof,
your theorem will immediately lose its green check marks.  We'll see that
soon in upcoming tutorial pages, when we try some harder proofs.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="interacting-with-environments">Interacting with environments</h2>
<p>You can move your cursor in and out of environments in the expected ways, using
the mouse and arrow keys.  But there are many ways to interact with environments
while editing a document, including these:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you right-click an environment (not one of its inner expressions!) you can
   change which type of environment it is (e.g., from Theorem to Lemma).</li>
<li>If your cursor is at the start of an environment and you press Backspace, it
   merges it with the paragraph before.  (This typically deletes the environment,
   unless the previous paragraph was empty.)</li>
<li>If you want to insert a new, empty paragraph above or below the environment
   containing the cursor, see the relevant items on the Insert menu.  For
   example, you can insert a blank paragraph between the theorem and proof by
   putting your cursor in the theorem and choosing to insert a paragraph below
   it.</li>
<li>You can add new paragraphs inside a proof (or any kind of environment) by
   pressing enter while your cursor is inside it.  If you instead intended to
   add a paragraph outside the environment, see the previous bullet point.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="too-many-blue-borders">Too many blue borders?</h2>
<p>As you can see in the document above, we're starting to get a lot of blue
borders around content in the document.  On the one hand, this is great, because
we know exactly which portions of our document Lurch is paying attention to.
But on the other hand, it can be distracting, and it's not how math documents
typically look.</p>
<p>This is because you are currently in "editing mode," where the user usually
wants to see the blue borders, so that they can be aware of how their work is
being interpreted.  But in "presentation mode," those borders are hidden, so
that the document is more easily readable by a human.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Exercise: Switch modes</p>
<p>Toggle between editing mode and presentation mode using the relevant item on
the Document menu.  Also try using the corresponding keyboard shortcut
(Ctrl+0 on PC, Command+0 on Mac).  Note that the shortcut uses a zero, <em>not</em>
a capital "oh."</p>
</div>
<h2 id="more-environments">More environments</h2>
<p>If you right-click an environment and choose "Change environment type," you may
notice that there are many options besides just Theorem and Proof.  We will
learn how many of these work in later pages in this tutorial, starting with the
<a href="../tut-07-rules/">next tutorial page, on the Rule environment</a>.</p></div>
