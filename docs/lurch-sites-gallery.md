# Gallery of Lurch Sites

This is a gallery of all the Lurch Sites that have been created by the Lurch
developers and community.  Since the project has just begun, the gallery is
still small, but growing.

    The development repository doubles as a Lurch Site with no contents.  Fork
    this site only if you want to start with a completely blank canvas, and you
    want all developer tools installed so that you could modify the software
    itself and submit pull requests back to the developers.

!!! note "Example Lurch Site"
    <div style="column-count: 3"><div>

    This site serves as an example of how you can create your own Lurch Sites.
    As you read the documentation for
    [how to make a Lurch Site](how-to-create-a-lurch-site.md), you can compare
    what you read there to this example.  Its
    [homepage](http://lurchmath.github.io/example-lurch-site) shows how to
    customize some of its contents to suit your needs.

More coming soon!
