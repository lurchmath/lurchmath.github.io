# Checking your reasoning

<div class='lurch-embed' width='100%' height='400px'>
Let's state the obvious.  First, we `assume x < 0`.

Then we can surely conclude (drum roll) that `x < 0`!

## Passing your first quiz

The document above contains two meaningful mathematical expressions.  You know
that they are meaningful (not just expository) because of the orange font.
But Lurch has not yet given any indication of whether the (very simple!)
reasoning in the above document is correct.  Let's make that happen.

!!! note "Exercise: Ask for a grade"

    1. In the document shown above, click the Document menu and choose
       "Show/hide feedback."
    2. You should find that the second meaningful mathematics gets a green check
       mark from Lurch, your virtual grader.
    3. Hover your mouse pointer over that green check mark.  You should see
       Lurch give you some small positive feedback ("Good work!").

## Throwing the game

Let's make a mistake to be sure that Lurch isn't practicing grade inflation.
If we do something mathematically invalid, it ought to make an error.

!!! note "Exercise: Oops"

    1. In the same document you see above, click the second expression to edit
       it.
    2. Change its meaning from $x<0$ to $y<0$ and click OK.
    3. Note that all feedback has disappeared from your document.  When you make
       an edit, Lurch is aware that its previous feedback may no longer apply,
       and it erases it.
    4. Ask Lurch to check your reasoning again, and then use your mouse to hover
       over the feedback icon (a yellowish question mark) for more information.

Lurch doesn't tell you that you're wrong.  This is appropriate because Lurch
doesn't want to jump to conclusions.  After all, maybe $y<0$ and maybe it
isn't; we haven't specified!  So Lurch just lets you know that you haven't
provided any evidence to support this conclusion.  Whether it's true or false is
another matter.  Lurch is just reading the evidence you've provided (or failed
to provide).

## Questions?

This exercise may have raised many questions in your mind, such as how the first
expression counts as an assumption, why it didn't get any feedback attached to
it, and what are the limits of Lurch's mathematical knowledge.  We will cover
all of those things in this tutorial, one at a time.
