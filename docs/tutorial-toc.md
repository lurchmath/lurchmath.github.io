# Lurch Tutorials

The tutorial series below is for the Lurch application that is
[online here](http://lurchmath.github.io/lurchmath/lurch/app).

!!! warning

    The tutorials we have created so far cover only a portion
    of what Lurch can do. We are actively working on both the
    tutorials and the software, but the software has far more
    capabilities than the tutorials below cover. Check back soon!

## Lurch Intro Tutorial

This tutorial is designed for any curious instructor who is
considering using Lurch for a course (or a student in such a
